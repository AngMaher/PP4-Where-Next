## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files.

Usually in order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, nearly all of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated,
and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to the pages.

In order to properly validate my HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, I followed these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### Bugs/known 

- Througout the project I came across the same error I done alot of research online but could not find a working sol, I was onto the tutors twice but was not resolved. I found where the s where on elephantsql and was able to manually close them as the error arose. My mentor also had a look. So the issue is still unresolved.


![bug connections](/docs/testing/bug-connections.png)

UNRESOLVED

***

-  When the project was first deployed to Heroku the static files were not loading. After a lot of reseach the same thing was coming up over and over. Install whotenoise to solve this problem.  So I found a walk through video to help do this. I did and the problem was resolved.  When I went to do final deployment to site would not work and got an Internal Server Error. After talking to Tutors I was given two choices either delete whitenoise or do some changes to make whitenoise and cloudinary work together. I was also told that because I had installed both CKEditor and summernote it may cause problems. I made a few changes and to settings and got the site working again.

RESOLVED

***

- I have used summernote on the field to add content to blogs in the admin side. However when I went to use it on the field to add planning to the bucket list I could get it to work on the admin side, but could not get it to show up on the template page for the site User. I decided to use CKEditor for this instead and it resolved the issue and everything was working.  However I was talking to a Tutor because of above error and was advised to use one or the other and not both. So I deleted CKEditor. I am still back to the same problem. My mentor can not see a reason for it not to work, and I was advised to mention it here.
