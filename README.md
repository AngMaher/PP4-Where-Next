## About

This website is a Travel Blog, a travel blog with a difference. There are lots of different blog articles to read to inspire your next adventure. 
Not only that! You can set up your own private Travel Bucket List, and also plan how to make each one a reality!!

The User has access to all the blogs on the site, once registered and logged in, they can interact with the each blog by liking and commenting. 

This site also allows them to store their very one Travel Bucket List, They can:
  - Create new items on their list.
  - Edit any of their ideas.
  - Delete any they longer want to achieve.
  - Mark off as done, when they have completed them.
  
Then they can take it a little further....
For each Item on their Bucket List, lets say "Want to travel to Rome". They can:
  - Add extra content. This is to make their wish into a reality and plan their trip. Any images they find, or links to hotels, flights etc. 
  Any information they come across can be stored here. Or a list of items they need to buy etc. Its like an online mood board 
  - They can view their plan, without going into edit mode, to see their plan come together.

## User Experience

I wanted to keep the design clean, clear and simple to show a contempary and uncluttered design.  The site is mainly off white for the background and blue a colour to premote travel.

### Wireframes

### Colour Scheme

I decided to keep the website bright with a main colur of blue throughout the site. 

  - #343434 - Jet, this colour is used a on the majority of the text throughout the site, and the footer.
  - #5799E1 - Blue, this is used on many features, buttons and highlighting links etc.
  - #FDF8F4 - Off white, this is used as the main background colour of the site.
  - #E64141 - Orange, this colour is used for the many messages and confirmations on the site.

### Bugs/known issues


## Deployment

### Git and GitHub
- Code Institute template was used to create GitHub public repository PP4-WHERE_NEXT.

- I developed programm, often commiting changes using terminal commands.

- I made sure that all my libraries and packages are listed in requirements.txt.

- When program was ready for further deployment I visited heroku.com website to deploy on heroku.



### Deployment to Heroku
- I visited https://heroku.com/ and opened dashboard. Then I clicked button "New" and selected "Create new app" button.

- I entered my app name as "PP4-Where-Next", region to Europe and clicked on "Create app" button

- The next step was to go to "Deploy" tab and then to "Deployment method" section to authorize and connect my GitHub account.

![connect github](/assets/images/connectgithub.png)

- When succesfully connected I selected main branch from "PP4-WHERE-NEXT " repository.

- Then I went to "Settings" tab

- In the next step I went to "Config Vars" section and added KEY "CREDS" with value of my credentials file creds.json (copy all and paste).

![config vars](/assets/images/configvars.png)

- Next to "Buildpacks" section. In the next step I added pyhton and nodejs buildpacks, making sure python was first then nodejs.

![buildpacks](/assets/images/buildpacks.png)

- In the next step I went back to "Deploy" tab and decided to use manual mode, however automatic mode is also available to deploy, which I done at a later time.

![connected screen](/assets/images/connected.png)

- The link to my deployed app was shown on screen: [Live Link](https://st-mochtas-fc.herokuapp.com/)
